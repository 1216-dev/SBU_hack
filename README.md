# SBU_hack
To develop an AI-driven disease diagnosis system that not only predicts diseases but also provides interpretable and transparent explanations for its decisions. The system will help medical professionals understand AI-driven diagnoses, ensuring trust, accuracy, and regulatory compliance through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

# **Explainable AI-Based Disease Diagnosis System**

## **Overview**
This project develops an AI-driven disease diagnosis system that not only predicts diseases but also provides interpretable and transparent explanations for its decisions. The goal is to enhance trust, accountability, and decision-making in medical AI systems.

## **Features**
- **Disease Prediction & Classification**: AI-based analysis of medical data (X-rays, EHRs, tabular data) for disease detection.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques**:
  - **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for feature importance in tabular and text data.
  - **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to explain model decision-making.
  - **Grad-CAM** for highlighting important regions in medical images.
  - **Counterfactual Explanations** for alternative decision scenarios.
  - **Attention Mechanisms** for understanding AI-based text analysis.
- **User Interface**: Interactive dashboard for doctors to upload patient data and visualize explanations.
- **Bias Detection & Fairness Audits**: Ensuring AI models provide unbiased and fair predictions.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Languages**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI / Flask for backend, React for frontend
- **Explainability Libraries**: SHAP, LIME, Captum (for PyTorch), ELI5
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP for cloud-based model hosting

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExplainableAI-DiseaseDiagnosis.git
   cd ExplainableAI-DiseaseDiagnosis
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**
1. **Run the API Server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
